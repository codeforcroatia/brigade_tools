#Scrapers

[OpenCivicData tools](http://opencivicdata.org/) and [Pupa.rb](https://github.com/opennorth/pupa-ruby) are two projects that focus on the mining, transforming and persisting steps. OpenCivicData is written in Python and focuses on people, organizations, votes, events and bills. For people, organizations and votes, it stores the data in Popolo format. Pupa.rb is written in Ruby and is more open-ended; you can use it to scrape any data type. Both are configurable and are run from the command-line.
